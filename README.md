# ai_rogue

This is an experiment in using ai to code.

I am using it to build something rogue-like.

At this point most of the code is ai-generated, with
human direction.

So as a license for now it is licensed under the unlicense/public domain with a note 
that it is generated by Claude (Anthropic)
